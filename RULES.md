# RULES TO DEV BY

1. Aim for stability

1. Aim for consistency across providers

1. Aim for easy repurposing and ease of use

1. Aim for good documentation

1. More providers are always welcome

1. Hooks into other provisioners are welcome, but not other provisioning code (except for SaltStack, which we may expand with sample states for people to use.)

1. If it can be done with SaltStack or Vagrant, it probably should be. Other tools (e.g. Bash) should be added in with discerning fashion.
